\section{Considerations in pretrained knowledge}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item \points{2a}
Succinctly explain why the pretrained (vanilla) model was able to achieve an accuracy of above 10\%, whereas the non-pretrained model was not.

% ISS
% \part[2]
\item \points{2b}
Take a look at some of the correct predictions of the pretrain+finetuned vanilla model, as well as some of the errors.
We think you'll find that it's impossible to tell, just looking at the output, whether the model \textit{retrieved} the correct birth place, or \textit{made up} an incorrect birth place.
Consider the implications of this for user-facing systems that involve pretrained NLP components.
Come up with two reasons why this indeterminacy of model behavior may cause concern for such applications.

\begin{answer}
% ### START CODE HERE ###
% ### END CODE HERE ###
\end{answer}

% ISS
% \part[2]
\item \points{2c}
If your model didn't see a person's name at pretraining time, and that person was not seen at fine-tuning time either, it is not possible for it to have ``learned'' where they lived.
Yet, your model will produce \textit{something} as a predicted birth place for that person's name if asked.
Concisely describe a strategy your model might take for predicting a birth place for that person's name, and one reason why this should cause concern for the use of such applications.
